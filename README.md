# Employee Management System

This Employee Management System is a robust tool designed for managing employee data within organizations. It integrates seamlessly with an SQLite database to handle operations such as adding, searching, editing, and exporting employee data to Excel files. This system also incorporates real-time analysis of time and space complexity, providing insights into the efficiency of its operations.

## Features
